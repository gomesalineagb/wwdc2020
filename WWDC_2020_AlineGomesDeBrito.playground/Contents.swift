# *A game about Collaboration*
  A platform game


## How to Play:
- Use your arrow keys **‚Üê‚Üë‚Üí‚Üì** to control the current character.
- Use your key **Q** to change the character.
- The arrow **‚¨áÔ∏é** indicates which character you are controlling.
- Navigate all the characters to the door in order to advance to the next level.
- You can Restart  the level by clicking at **‚ü≥**

The objective of the game is to pass all levels, combining the different abilities of the characters.

Each Character has a different ability, you have to combine them to achieve the door, and all of this with the Light-Off üòú(hope you're not afraid of the dark üò≥). *Try to use all the characters!*

## **Good Luck and Have Fun!**
