# wwdc2020 Submission for Swift Student Challenge WWDC20
# ACCEPTED 🥳🎉🎊🥳

# *A game about Collaboration*
  A platform game


## How to Play:
- Use your arrow keys **←↑→↓** to control the current character.
- Use your key **Q** to change the character.
- The arrow **⬇︎** indicates which character you are controlling.
- Navigate all the characters to the door in order to advance to the next level.
- You can Restart  the level by clicking at **⟳**

The objective of the game is to pass all levels, combining the different abilities of the characters.

Each Character has a different ability, you have to combine them to achieve the door, and all of this with the Light-Off 😜(hope you're not afraid of the dark 😳). *Try to use all the characters!*

## **Good Luck and Have Fun!**
